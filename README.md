# Allnie Keychain


## At Allnie Key chain we are building an opensource wallet that will enable any and all crypto developers to add thier currency into the wallet. Our guding principles are as follows: 

### Currency Customization over gatekeeping: I wanna be able to add any cryptocurrency I want vs having a central party dictate what currency gets added 


### Function over aesthetic: The wallet should be functional, friendly enough for advanced users. Aesthetics are designed by the open source community. 

So the journey begins! Will you be a part of it?

# Allnie Keychain


## Allnie Key chain is building an opensource wallet that enables anyone to add their currency into the wallet. Our guiding principles are as follows:  

### Currency Customization over gatekeeping: You are able to add any cryptocurrency you want vs having a central party dictate what currency gets added 


### Function over aesthetic: The wallet should be functional, friendly enough for users. Aesthetics are designed by the open source community. 

So the journey begins! Will you be a part of it?

Allnie Keychain

At Allnie Key chain we are building an opensource wallet that will enable any and all crypto developers to add thier currency into the wallet. Our guding principle is as follows: 

Currency Customization over gatekeeping: I wanna be able to add any cryptocurrency I want vs having a central party dictate what currency gets added 


Function over aesthetic: The wallet should be functional, friendly enough for advanced users. Aesthetics are designed by the open source community. 

So the journey begins! Will you be a part of it?
